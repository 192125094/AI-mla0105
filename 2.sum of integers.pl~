% Base case: Sum of integers from 1 to 0 is 0.
sum_up_to_n(0, 0).

% Recursive case: Sum of integers from 1 to n is N plus the sum of integers from 1 to (n-1).
sum_up_to_n(N, Sum) :-
    N > 0,                  % Ensure N is a positive integer
    Prev is N - 1,          % Calculate (n-1)
    sum_up_to_n(Prev, PrevSum),  % Recursive call to get sum of integers from 1 to (n-1)
    Sum is N + PrevSum.     % Calculate sum of integers from 1 to n
